# Troubleshooting & Next Steps

## Common Issues

### Resource Constraints
```bash
# Check system resources
free -h
df -h
top

# Docker resource usage
docker stats
```

### Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test endpoints
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_version","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $ETH_ENDPOINT

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_version","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $POLYGON_ENDPOINT
```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Checks
1. Monitor system resources
2. Verify chain synchronization
3. Check transaction relay status
4. Review error logs

### Weekly Tasks
1. Update node software
2. Backup configuration
3. Verify contract states
4. Performance optimization

## Next Steps
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Monitoring system implementation
- Scaling strategy development
- Production deployment planning
